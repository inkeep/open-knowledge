/**
 * Server-side bridge invariant watchdog.
 *
 * Y.Text-is-truth contract assertion site: after Observer B Phase 1 derives
 * fragment from `parse(ytext)`, the watchdog asserts that the post-write
 * bridge invariant holds:
 *
 *   normalizeBridge(ytext.toString())
 *     === normalizeBridge(prependFrontmatter(fm, mdManager.serialize(fragment)))
 *
 * Outside the `normalizeBridge` tolerance set, the watchdog fires:
 *   - dev (`NODE_ENV=test` or `OK_BRIDGE_THROW_ON_VIOLATION=1`):
 *     throws `BridgeInvariantViolationError` so integration tests + fuzz
 *     runs surface the regression loudly.
 *   - prod: emits a structured `bridge-invariant-violation` console.warn
 *     event (machine-readable JSON) + increments
 *     `bridgeInvariantViolations`. Rate-limited per (site, doc) tuple so
 *     a single buggy doc cannot drown the signal.
 *
 * Lives in its own module because precedent #13(b) bans wall-clock
 * SCHEDULING (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`) in `server-observers.ts` —
 * see `bridge-no-wallclock.test.ts` for the enforced gate's `FORBIDDEN`
 * regex array. The rate-limiter needs `Date.now()` for window comparison;
 * co-locating it here keeps timer machinery isolated even though the
 * precedent gate doesn't cover `Date.now()` directly (server-observers.ts
 * itself uses `new Date().toISOString()` for the timestamp field of its
 * own structured-log events).
 *
 * Telemetry payload is bounded-cardinality and content-redacted by default:
 * site, docName-or-null, the tolerance-class label (`'untracked'` for
 * unknown classes — the comparator stack tolerates known byte classes plus
 * the parse-equivalence fallback, so a violation past ALL of them is by
 * definition untracked), and FNV-1a digests of the
 * ytext + fragment snapshots for cross-event correlation. The truncated
 * unifiedDiff is included as `diff` ONLY when `OK_TELEMETRY_VERBOSE=1`
 * (mirrors the sibling `bridge-merge-content-loss` opt-in pattern). Full
 * snapshots travel only on the thrown error for dev triage; never logged.
 *
 * @see packages/core/src/bridge/normalize.ts (tolerance set)
