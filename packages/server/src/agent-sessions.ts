 *
 * Each session creates a Y.UndoManager tracking [Y.Text, flashMap]

 * applyAgentUndo path; captureTransaction excludes it from the UM stack

/**
 * Y.Text-is-truth agent undo. The only sanctioned server-side undo write

 * anti-pattern.
 *
 * Calls session.um.undo() INSIDE an outer doc.transact(..., session.undoOrigin)
 * so Y.js merges the UM's internal transaction into the outer. The whole
 * operation fires under undoOrigin (paired: true) → Observer A/B short-circuit.
 *
 * After undo, Y.Text holds the user's intended post-undo bytes (precedent
 * #38). XmlFragment derives via `parseWithFallback(body)` →
 * `updateYFragment` so the structural diff preserves user-content Items at
 * matching positions. NO canonicalize-write-back step: re-serializing the
 * fragment and applying that to ytext would defeat the contract by
 * canonicalizing user-typed source-form bytes (e.g. `__foo__` → `**foo**`,
 * `:---:` table widths, ATX trailing hashes). Post-undo bridge invariant
 * divergence (if any) is detected by Observer B's watchdog.
 *
 * scope 'last': undo one UM stack item.
 * scope 'session': undo entire UM stack.
 *
 * Returns `true` when at least one UM frame was popped (i.e., the undo had
 * an observable effect), `false` when the stack was already empty. Callers
 * can surface this to the HTTP response so MCP clients know the no-op case.
 *
 * Contract — every requirement is load-bearing; do not relax without re-running
 * the bridge fuzzer + conversion-PBT suite that guards against the bug-A class:
 *
 *   (1) Y.Text-is-truth composition (precedent #38). Y.UndoManager has
 *       already mutated ytext to its desired post-undo state; XmlFragment
 *       derives via parse(ytext). Do NOT re-canonicalize ytext from the
 *       fragment — that defeats the contract.
 *   (2) Fires under per-session `session.undoOrigin`, distinct from
 *       `session.origin`. The UM is constructed with
 *       `captureTransaction: tr => tr.origin !== session.undoOrigin` so
 *       undo-of-undo never lands on the stack.
 *   (3) No client-side cross-CRDT writes. Server-authoritative observer-
 *       bridge is the only mirror path; client observers are baseline-only
 *       (precedent #14).
 *   (4) Single `doc.transact()` block — no defensive mutex. The atomicity
 *       comes from the transact, not from extra serialization.
 *   (5) Every change here ships with fuzzer + conversion-PBT coverage.
 *
 * Cross-deploy transition: undo-stack frames captured BEFORE the
 * Y.Text-is-truth migration contain canonical bytes (post-Phase-2
 * canonicalize-write-back). After deploy, undo through those frames
 * restores canonical bytes, while frames captured under contract restore
 * raw user bytes. Mixed-form undo across the boundary is acceptable
 * transition behavior — the UM stack is per-session and ephemeral.
